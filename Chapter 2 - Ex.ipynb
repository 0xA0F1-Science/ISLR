    "(a) A large number of samples and a lower number of predictors and thus lower number of dimensions mean a flexible method can catch more complex relationships and avoid overfitting. The flexible method is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Here it's the opposite. The flexible method is worse as it increases the chance for overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) The flexible method is better as it could find the non-linear relationships in the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) $\\sigma^2 = Var(\\epsilon)$ is the irreducible error. If it is high, the flexible model finds relationships between the response and the large irreducible error (could result in overfitting). Threrfore a flexible model performs worse the an inflexible model that is more robust against the large irreducible error."
